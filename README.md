This repository contains hub software that should be executed on a Raspberry pi model 3b, contained in `./hub`.

`./hub` also contains generate_services.py which is used to generate cpp files contained in `inc/` and `source/` from `translations.json`.

All python scripts should be executed from the folder they are contained in as paths are relative.

pip modules are required, cd into hub and perform `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
